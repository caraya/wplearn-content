# FSE Lessons Learned

## Topic Description

Creating themes with the FSE is a completely new development experience.  From little to no coding to differences in the way that you create and save your content, there are many things to learn about FSE, particularly if you're familiar and comfortable creating classic themes and plugins

## Manage your expectations

This is the first, and most important, lesson when starting to work in the full site editor. It's important to understand what you're working with and to tailor your expectations to the framework and tools that you have available.

One of my earliest peeves with Gutenberg was that at the time it would allow lists inside a quote block (that would produce HTML blockquotes elements) and someone pointed out that I was whining about it.

Besides the fact that I don't appreciate that comment in the context it was given, after all what I was asking for was a basic feature present in most HTML authoring tools and in the existing PHP-based WordPress editor, it brought up another line of thiking: **Even though this is not a finished project (and it likely won't be for a while), it is progressing in a better way than what I expected**.

Another area to consider is that regardless of what developers like me want, this is the way that things will be moving foward so it's either adapt or get left behind.
