# Learn WordPress Content

Repository for content I've authored for [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/). It is divided into three sections:

* Images
  * PSD and PNG images used in lesson plans
* Initial content
  * Initial writeups for lesson plans
  * They are different than the versions in Learn. Those are the final published versions of the content
* Code
  * Materials for users to download to follow along the exercises in some of the lesson plans
